Hello!

My name is Chris Tardy and I'm an incoming Computer Science student at the University of British Columbia.

I developed this prototype of Mabel as part of BlueDot Impact's AI Alignment course.

The idea behind Mabel is that at-origin verification of human text is a better long-term way to authenticate real, human work than AI detection tools.

Text typed in the document is green, pasted text is orange and gets added to a memory bank below the text container. At a later stage of the prototype, any matches between the table and the text box would be flagged as copying the pasted text.

I'm most interested in how this tool could be applied to education and reducing accusations of AI plaigiarism.

Some ideas I have:

- developing a sort of webpage like Spotify wrapped for why we think a document is authentic based on the behaviour of the user. For example, their typing speed, how often they backspaced, whether the subnmitted text was typed or copy-pasted (the prototype), and at what point the words appearing in the final doc appeared. These are all possible measurable proxies for human-generated work.
- developing an animated assistant named Mabel (check the assets folder) who will be able to explain to students and teachers alike how it thinks AI played a role in the creation of the document, and even warning students before they submit their document that their work does not follow the teacher's rules
- using blockchain to authenticate a document's certificate that it is human-generated. National University of Singapore as a cool example of this, but for their transcripts.
- building upon some research that measures the biometrics of different students as they write their essays and assignments. https://arxiv.org/abs/2101.05570

Some perspective that I think is important: although we've heard of students in university and high school getting accused of AI plaigiarism, computer literacy starts young. I made my first PowerPoint for a class at the age of 8. It probably has started earlier since. We are dealing with AI's relationship to learning at all levels of K-12 education and beyond.

Overall, I'm quite excited by the possibilities that Mabel could bring to the classroom. As someone who entered the workforce as ChatGPT was released, I've watched it evolve in the knowledge economy and have the perspective that we shouldn't be outright discouraging students from getting help from AI in their assignments. We need to better understand how AI impacts learning and be as transparent and definitive as possible when establishing guardrails for schoolwork.

Thank you for looking at my project!
